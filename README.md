# SoBioS - Sobol indices for Biological Systems

SoBioS is an easy to run Matlab code used for Sobol' indices global sensitivity analysis of Biological Systems. It strongly uses the utilities available in the UQLab package (https://www.uqlab.com/). The implementation follows an educational style, to make its use very intuitive, in the same style that can be seen in UQLab tutorials.


The SoBioS code consists of the following modules:

SoBioS_CaseName.m - main file for the simulation (use servaral resourses from UQLab package)

QoI_CaseName.m    - function to compute the Quantity of Interest (QoI)

valplot.m - function to compute and plot validation and error's metrics

## UQLab dependency

In order to use the SoBioS code, it is necessary to have UQLab package installed:
https://www.uqlab.com

This external package is free for academic use.

## Support

A tutotial for the SoBioS packages is provided in the following book chapter:
